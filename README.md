# ym-bounds

Explicit, reproducible bounds and constant saturation for a 4D SU(3) Yang–Mills mass-gap proof:
- Quadratic contraction (A, η*)
- Collar-loss summability (C)
- SU(3) rep tail bounds (character/Casimir)
- Tube-cost ⇒ spectral gap (τ₀ → m₀)
- String tension in physical units (σ_phys)
- Exponential clustering constant (m*)

## Quick start
